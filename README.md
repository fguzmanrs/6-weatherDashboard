# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. 

## User Story

AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Business Context
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

## Weather Dashboard works as follows:
<!-- 
User can search for weather reports by city using the openweathermap API.
* Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. 

* Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* App will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Application uses icons to represent weather conditions.

After searching for a city, the following information is displayed:
    Current temperature
    Current humidity
    Windspeed
    UV index
    5 day forecast
* Display the following under current weather conditions:
    - City
    - Date
    - Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Wind speed
    - UV index

* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:
    - Date
    - Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
    - Temperature
    - Humidity

Application stores previously searched for cities in localstorage and displays them to the user.
Application loads last searched city forecast on page load.
* Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.


Hints

-Create multiple functions within your application to handle the different parts of the dashboard:
    - Current conditions
    - 5-Day Forecast
    - Search history
    - UV index

Make more than one AJAX call.

Hardcode some of the parameters in the API's URL. User input will determine some of the other parameters.

Use localStorage to store any persistent data. -->

## Future version to include:

* Geolocation API to add the user's current location to the initial landing page
